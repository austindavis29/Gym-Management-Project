# SideProject : Gym Management System

The Gym Management system program will create an environment in which a gym manager can view a complete list of members, search for individual members, and organize the list by Member ID or last name. 

This is an ongoing project, and certain aspects of the code are not yet utilized. 

Note: I have used code online to help make this program. I will source as necessary.
