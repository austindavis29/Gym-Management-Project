# SideProject : Gym Management System

The Gym Management system program will create an environment in which a gym manager can view a complete list of members, search for individual members, organize the list by Member ID or last name, and add or remove members.

Note: I have used code online to help make this program. I will source as necessary.

How to use/access this project:
The user will need to have Dev-C++ downloaded onto their computer. They will then download the zip file and extract all of the files. Next, the user will open Dev-C++ and create a new project. This new project will then have the main.cpp file removed, the two extracted .cpp files added, and the extracted .h file added to it. After this, the project can be compiled and successfully run.
